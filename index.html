        <p style="font-family:cursive;">To my lovely girl, I hope you don't think this looks too terrible although I wouldn't blame you as I am pretty bad at coding. Learning how to do this has been in the works for months but I still haven't gotten very far. Regardless, this is something that I've been wanting to do for you because to me, this is me learning another language to express my love for you. It's crazy to think that we have been together for over a year and a half and well it all feels like a distant memory but at the same time feels like its only been a couple of months. It makes sense though because when I'm with you, I lose all sense of time. You make this very crazy world seem peaceful anytime I hear your silly giggle or anytime I see your wonderful smile. I'm always left wondering how such a sweet girl ended up in such an imperfect world like this and especially with such an imperfect person. You are who I strive to be like everyday because you are such an admirable individial who should be proud of the person you are. </p>
        <p>Below, is something that I hope you like
